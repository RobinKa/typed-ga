# Typed Geometric Algebra
TypeScript Geometric Algebra implementations with proper typing. Autogenerated using Python and TFGA.

# Structure
- `generated/`: TypeScript implementations for Geometric Algebras with different signatures ordered as `0 -> -1 -> +1` (eg. signature `[0, -1, 1, 1]` is `ga_zmpp.ts`)
- `generated_js/`: Same as `generated/` but transpiled to JavaScript
- `tsgen.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that generates the TypeScript implementations
- `example.ts`: The example from the above screenshot
- [`intro.ipynb`](https://github.com/RobinKa/typed-ga/blob/master/intro.ipynb): Motivation and introduction for Geometric Algebra

# Generating new algebras
To generate new algebras running the notebook is required. The notebook requires installing [TFGA](https://github.com/RobinKa/tfga). The last cell contains the
code to generate the TypeScript files. Here arbitrary signatures can be defined to be generated.
