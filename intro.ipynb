    "## Rotating 2D vectors\n",
    "Given a 2D vector $v = \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix} = x e_x + y e_y$ how do we rotate the vector given a rotation angle $\\phi$?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using 2x2 Rotation Matrices\n",
    "A common solution is to use rotation matrices. In the 2D case it will be a 2x2 matrix of the following form: ![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fe4ee3f1ce8e028da5bd4219c9dc7fc2216543e4).\n",
    "Multiplying the vector and the matrix together we arrive at ![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fb49189b01f28a896f2864942db6fa40994513c5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotations can be composed by multiplying two or more matrices together to obtain a single matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of this method is that we need to calculate the 2x2 matrix which contains 4 numbers which seems more than actually necessary. Also while rotation matrices\n",
    "do exist for other dimensions it is usually not easy to come up with them. They are often either memorized or require a lookup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Complex Numbers\n",
    "Another common tool for 2D rotation are the complex numbers. First note that if we multiply a complex number with the imaginary unit $i$ the complex number will get rotated by 90째.\n",
    "By multiplying by integer powers of $i$ we can rotate by integer multiples of 90째, for example multiplying by $i^3$ will rotate by 270째.\n",
    "However in order to create arbitrary rotations phi, we need to form the exponential $e^{\\phi i}$ and multiply by it.\n",
    "The exponential of a scaled imaginary number $e^{\\phi i}$ is given by $cos(\\phi) + i sin(\\phi)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in order to achieve what we wanted, we need to represent our vector $v$ as a complex number $x + y i$ (ie. the x coordinate becomes the real part and the y coordinate becomes the imaginary part).\n",
    "Then we can apply the formula from above to rotate by an arbitrary angle $phi$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$(x + y i) e^{\\phi i} = (x + y i) (cos(\\phi) + i sin(\\phi)) = (x cos(\\phi) - y sin(\\phi)) + i (x sin(\\phi) + y cos(\\phi))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we compare this to what we arrived at using rotation matrices the result is identical. Similarly we can also compose rotations by multiplying two or more complex numbers together\n",
    "to arrive at a single complex number.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now only need to store two numbers for a rotation. Nevertheless the approach still leaves some questions. The conversion between vectors and complex numbers seems arbitrary. Furthermore this approach only works in 2 dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using 2D Geometric Algebra\n",
    "Like standard vectors in geometric algebra we also have vectors with the two basis vectors $e_x, e_y$. Squaring the basis vectors results in $+1$, also the same\n",
    "as when using standard vectors. What is new is that, without further detail for now,\n",
    "we can multiply these basis vectors in new ways such as the product $e_x e_y = e_{xy}$ (ie. writing $e_{xy}$ is just shorthand for $e_x e_y$).\n",
    "A rule is that when you swap two neighbouring indices you pick up a minus sign, eg. $e_{xy} = e_x e_y = -e_y e_x = -e_{yx}$.\n",
    "Let's see what happens if we multiply two of these together, that is, squaring it:\n",
    "\n",
    "$e_{xy} e_{xy} = -e_{xy} e_{yx} = -e_x e_y e_y e_x = -e_x e_x = -1$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see the square of $e_{xy}$ is $-1$, the same as the imaginary unit of the complex numbers. We call the elements made out of two vectors bivectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve the disconnect of vectors and complex numbers we make use of geometric algebra. Vectors are represented as before, but we write out the vectors\n",
    "as a linear combination the basis vectors $v = x e_x + y e_y$. As mentioned before $e_{xy}$ can be identified as the imaginary unit $i$ hence we present complex numbers as $a + b e_{xy}$ and a rotation by an arbitrary angle $\\phi$ can be performed in the same way as before using $e^{\\phi e_{xy}} = cos(\\phi) + e_{xy} sin(\\phi)$.\n",
    "This time we don't need to perform the arbitrary conversion between vectors and complex numbers, we can simply multiply\n",
    "them together as is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$(x e_x + y e_y) (cos(\\phi) + e_{xy} sin(\\phi)) = e_x (x cos(\\phi) - y sin(\\phi)) + e_y (x sin(\\phi) + y cos(\\phi))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This result is the same as the other two results and pretty much identical to what we did with complex numbers, however this time we don't have to do any conversion between vectors and complex numbers\n",
    "and we really can use a vector as input and output. We can also see that the imaginary unit is in fact a rotation in the XY plane whose basis is formed by multiplying the basis vectors of the x and y axis.\n",
    "So far it seems that at best we gained some clarity (which is good, but might not justify using it over the well known complex numbers and vectors yet). The big advantage of this approach as we will see in the next\n",
    "sections is that this generalizes to any dimension and does not require any memorization besides the basic geometric algebra rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rotating 3D vectors\n",
    "Now we go up one dimension to three dimensional space. Things will get a bit more complicated in the usual approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using 3x3 Rotation Matrices\n",
    "As in the 2D case we can look up the 3D rotation matrix formula on Wikipedia or some other place\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/242deb7010fd504134a6cacab3d0ef4ce02e7613)\n",
    "\n",
    "And multiplying a 3D vector with it will give us the desired result. Some people might be able to memorize this formula but I think it is obvious to see that this approach\n",
    "will not scale into higher dimensions easily. Additionally we now require 3x3=9 numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using 3D Geometric Algebra\n",
    "We now have three basis vector $e_x, e_y, e_z$ and as a result three independent bivectors $e_{xy}, e_{xz}, e_{yz}$.\n",
    "Let's see what the bivectors square to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$e_{xy} e_{xy} = -e_{xy} e_{yx} = -1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$e_{xz} e_{xz} = -e_{xz} e_{zx} = -1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$e_{yz} e_{yz} = -e_{yz} e_{zy} = -1$\n",
    "\n",
    "All three of our bivectors square to $-1$. Some readers might be familiar with quaternions which have the same property for their three imaginary units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously I mentioned that $e_{xy}$ can be used to represent a rotation in the XY plane, so one might already suspect what $e_{xz}$ and $e_{yz}$ can be used for. \n",
    "If we form $R_{xz} = e^{\\pi e_{xz}}$ one would think that this produces a rotation by 90째 ($\\pi$ in degrees) in the XZ plane when multiplying a 3D vector by it.\n",
    "This is almost correct. It turns out that the 2D case was special and the general formula for applying \"rotors\" (the thing you get after exponentiating, such as\n",
    "$R_{xz}$ here) requires a two sided product $R v \\widetilde{R}$ where $\\widetilde{R}$ means reversing the order of all basis vectors appearing in it (eg. $\\widetilde{\\phi e_{xz}} = \\phi e_{zx} = -\\phi e_{xz})$.\n",
    "Another result of this is that the number in the exponent needs to be half of what it was before since we are multiplying by it twice. One could then verify that the result of such a sandwich product\n",
    "yields the same results in 2D as the one sided product.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to put this all together, a 3D rotation in the XZ plane can be generated using\n",
    "\n",
    "$R_{xz} = e^{\\frac{\\phi}{2} e_{xz}} = cos(\\frac{\\phi}{2}) + e_xz sin(\\frac{\\phi}{2})$\n",
    "\n",
    "by sandwiching a 3D vector with it\n",
    "\n",
    "$v' = R_{xz} v \\widetilde{R}_{xz} = (cos(\\frac{\\phi}{2}) + e_{xz} sin(\\frac{\\phi}{2})) v \\widetilde{(cos(\\frac{\\phi}{2}) + e_{xz} sin(\\frac{\\phi}{2}))} = (cos(\\frac{\\phi}{2}) + e_{xz} sin(\\frac{\\phi}{2})) x (cos(\\frac{\\phi}{2}) - e_{xz} sin(\\frac{\\phi}{2}))$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to perform arbitrary 3D rotations in multiple planes we can just apply multiple of these rotors, for example a rotation in XY plane then the XZ plane then YZ plane\n",
    "by angles $a, b, c$ respectively can be performed using three sandwich products in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$v' = R_{yz}(c) R_{xz}(b) R_{xy}(a) v \\widetilde{R}_{xy}(a) \\widetilde{R}_{xz}(b) \\widetilde{R}_{yz}(c)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The three rotors $R_{xy}(a), R_{xz}(b), R_{yz}(c)$ can also be combined into a single rotor $R(a, b, c)$ by multiplying them together. The same thing can then be achieved\n",
    "using a single sandwich product\n",
    "\n",
    "$v' = R(a, b, c) v \\widetilde{R}(a, b, c)$\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out the rotors will contain 4 numbers (the scalar part and a coefficient for each of the bivectors) much less than the 9 of the 3x3 rotation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully it is now possible to see that the Geometric Algebra approach will generalize to any dimension. For example in 4D we would have 6 planes of rotation and thus 6 bivectors, and one can generate rotations in them using exactly the same approach with the exponential and sandwich product.\n",
